# Sync-Test
Git sync testing project between GitHub and GitLab. 

## Goal

I want to use GitHub and GitLab concurrently, particularly for personal projects. I'm going to be experimenting with adding GitLab as a secondary URL in `origin`.

## Code


`git remote set-url ––add origin https://gitlab.com/user/repo.git`
